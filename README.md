# Picture Poker Scratch
A remake of the Picture Poker minigame from Super Mario 64 DS and New Super Mario Bros. in Scratch 3. Made in Turbowarp, although it requires no Turbowarp modules and can run in base Scratch 3.

## Setup
### Online
Picture Poker Scratch can be played online on the [official GitHub site](https://calebri.github.io/picture-poker-scratch/). The site will automatically update when a new version is released.

### Offline
There are many ways to to play Picture Poker Scratch offline. The `sb3.` file can be downloaded and run via the [Scratch 3 desktop app](https://scratch.mit.edu/download) or [Turbowarp Desktop](https://desktop.turbowarp.org/). This project does support Turbowarp interpolation.
